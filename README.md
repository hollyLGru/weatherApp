This application was built using Vite js framework. It is a front end application that pinpoints the user's latitude and longitude and returns the current weather
and time based on user's location! It also has a contact form (not active, just demonstrated). This application is also responsive and will change layout when 
viewed on a desktop vs mobile screen.
